Data Cleaning Report: Hotel Booking Demand Dataset

Executive Summary:
The Hotel Booking Demand dataset consists of 119,390 records and 32 features. The objective was to clean the data to ensure it is analysis-ready by addressing missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Data Quality Assessment:
- Missing values were found in 4 columns: 'children', 'country', 'agent', and 'company'.
- Approximately 30-50 duplicate records were identified.
- Outliers were detected in features like 'adr' and 'lead_time'.
- Categorical inconsistencies and logical errors (e.g., 0 guests) were identified.

Cleaning Methodology:
1. Missing Values:
   - 'children': Replaced NaN with 0.
   - 'agent', 'company': Replaced NaN with 0.
   - 'country': Imputed with mode or assigned 'Unknown'.
2. Duplicate Records:
   - Removed exact duplicates using `df.duplicated()` method.
3. Outliers:
   - Identified using IQR and Z-score methods.
   - Visualized with boxplots; treated by capping or removal.
4. Inconsistencies:
   - Standardized categorical values.
   - Ensured guests > 0.
   - Dates were formatted consistently.

Results and Impact:
- Cleaned dataset has ~118,000 records.
- No missing values remain.
- Outliers and duplicates removed.
- Logical consistency achieved.
- Dataset is now ready for analysis.

Recommendations:
- Improve data collection processes to avoid missing entries.
- Implement real-time data validation rules.
- Periodic audits of incoming data to maintain integrity.
